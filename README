AFMM is a Fast Multipole Method library for the Laplace equation in
axisymmetric domains.

Installation instructions are given in the file INSTALL. If you have
downloaded the github distribution, you will need to set up the
automake system by running

./autogen.sh

in the root directory of the source code. You can then go through the
usual autotools configure process

./configure (options)

It is very strongly recommended to compile wbfmm with the highest
level (-O3) of optimization. It makes a very big difference to the
performance, even compared to using the -O2 flag. You can do this with

CFLAGS="-O3 -g" ./configure ...

(remove -g to switch off debugging support)

To compile the code:

make

and to install it:

make install

If you want to generate the documentation:

make doxygen-doc

installs the html documentation in doc/html
